Fix old Xkb handling code. The original code, that could do some of the things listed below, has been ripped out.

Make sure to restore the keysyms for keys we've configured when exiting. Then we can potentially bind any key to any set of commands.
(i.e. we can add a macro EAK_EMITKEYS(x,y,z) to emit keycodes for keys x, y and z. However, were we to do this now, once
we exit lineakd, that key would cease to function.

Assign real symbols to each and every key. Currently, when mapped, we have a valid keysym and keycode, but no actual symbol.
A real symbol should allow us to not bind a key to a command, but also use it in keybindings w/ other programs, like in KDE or
GNOME.

#IDEA
Have a command line utility that:

Gets the scancode from a key that is pressed and asks the user for the definition of the key
 from input.h (input.h has all of the defines for keys and their corresponding keycodes in decimal.)
 With this information you can create a keymap for loadkeys or manually run a setkeycodes type function.
 This may have to be run on every boot, unless there is a way to map raw scan codes to keycodes or normal
 scancodes into some sort of map permanently.
